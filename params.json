However, no similar service exists for Google's \"Get it on Google Play\" badges.\r\n\r\nThis repository serves mostly as hosting for Google's badges in SVG format. Most of the files are in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/tree/gh-pages) branch.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n* Optimize SVGs to minimize file size (using [this](http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg_optimiser) for example).\r\n* Add \"Android App on\" badges\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSimply link to the badge you require like so:\r\n\r\n````\r\n<img src=\"http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/img/en_get.svg\">\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhich leads to [this](http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/img/en_get.svg) image. Pretty handy! Be sure to add your own URL as well:\r\n\r\n````\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.myapp\">\r\n<img alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/img/en_get.svg\" />\r\n</a>\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd you'll get something like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.myapp\">\r\n<img align=\"middle\" alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/img/en_get.svg\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nIt's that easy! With a little JavaScript to check for locale (check `navigator.language || navigator.browserLanguage`) you can then load language-specific versions of the badge:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.myapp\">\r\n<img align=\"middle\" alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/img/zh_get.svg\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOr, you can call some handy JavaScript!\r\n\r\n````\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/gh-pages/get-localized.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\ndocument.write(GetLocalizedPlayBadge.forCurrentLocale());\r\n</script>\r\n````\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions, suggestions, or comments!\r\n\r\n## Available badges\r\n\r\nTo view the list of available badges, please see [this folder](https://github.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/tree/gh-pages/img) or view all of the images in one place [here](http://steverichey.github.io/google-play-badge-svg/all.html). If I've made an error somewhere or you'd like an additional language added, please [open an issue](https://github.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/issues).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nBadges are labeled by their [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) codes wherever possible. Languages with multiple dialects, such as Chinese, are labeled by their ISO 639-1 code followed by their [ISO 639-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639_macrolanguage) language code.\r\n\r\nBy default, several versions of the Google Play badge use [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova), which is copyright Mark Simonson. As I do not own this font, it was replaced with [Myriad Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/myriad-pro). No fonts are embedded in the SVGs; instead, I opted to convert them to outlines to maximize compatibility.\r\n\r\nInclusion or omission of any language or dialect should not be misconstrued as support for any particular nationality, country, ideology, race, or similar. If there's a language in here, it's just because Google had it available or someone added it themselves. If a language is missing, it's just because Google did not have it available or I had issues with their file.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nUnless covered under some other license, all content in this repository is shared under an MIT license.
